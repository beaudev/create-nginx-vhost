# create-nginx-vhost

Simple script to speedup nginx vhost creation based on configuration files.

Use it with [bash profile](https://github.com/beaudev/bash-profile).

Once you start a new shell you should be able to use it like this : 
    do_nginx_new_vhost new_project symfony-php5-fpm-nginx /path/to/your/project "hodor.tld www.hodor.tld"
